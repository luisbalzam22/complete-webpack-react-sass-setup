//THE REASON WE SET AN ENTRYPOINT FOR VENDOR CODE (E.G.: 3RD PARTY LIBRARIES) IS TO KEEP THEM CACHED IN BROWSER, SINCE THEIR CODE DOESN'T CHANGE SO OFTEN (UNLINKE APPLICATION CODE).

//IF WE IMPORTED VENDOR CODE INSIDE OUR MAIN APPLICATION, AND APLLIED CACHE BUSTING, E-VE-RY TIME WE MAKE A CHANGE IN OUR APP CODE WOULD MAKE THE BROWSER HAVE TO DOWNLOAD NOT ONLY OUR APP CODE, BUT ALSO WOULD UNNECESSARILY DOWNLOAD ALL THE (USUALLY EXTENSIVE) VENDOR CODE
